# Investigate-no-show-appointment-dataset
Investigate data about medical appointments in Brazil to see if patients show up for their appointment

## Investigate-a-dataset

Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib to investigate (wrangle, explore, draw conclusions and communicate) a dataset


## Overview

In this project, I have analysed a dataset and then communicate the findings about it.


## Python libraries

    pandas
    NumPy
    Matplotlib

## Project tasks

  * A typical data analysis process: posing questions that can be answered and answering those questions
  * Investigate problems and wrangle the data into a format, and communicate the results
  * Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas, use pandas' Series and DataFrame objects
  * Use Matplotlib to produce plots

## Dataset

**noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv**

* This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

* A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row as follows:

 - ‘Scheduled Day’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
 - ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
 - ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
 - The last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.   

## Questions

**What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?**
